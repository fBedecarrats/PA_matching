# Re-implementing the logic of original study with a new code {#sec-reimplement}

We have not yet been able to successfully replicate the original study as their code does not run successfully and generates errors. We identified the origin of some errors and corrected them, but we remained stuck with Julia errors. We tried different computing environment : local, cloud servers and with several different configurations (Windows, Linux, different R, python and Julia versions, etc.), and with large amounts of CPUs and memory.

We believe that the computing sequence elaborated by this study authors is particularly complex because of the very large amount of data to be processed. We propose a different approach that seems more straight forward and use the same entry parameters as the original study.

Here we attempt to reproduce every analysis steps and parameters of the original study but to implement a different data processing strategy that:

-   implies less manipulations steps to be less error prone;
-   only relies on one language and configuration for local processing.
-   relies on cloud data processing for very big datasets: we leverage the cloud computing platform used by the authors to download their source data (Google earth engine) to do more than only data acquisition: we use it also to preprocess and combine the source data before download;;
-   takes advantage that the matching algorithm segments by country and biome to process the data in smaller batches that are easier to process on commonly accessible processing configurations.
-   containerize and archive our computing environement to enable any future researcher to reproduce it in the future.

```

We obtain `r nrow(aois)` polygons of country/biomes combinations.

We also download the data from [@curtis2018] on deforestation drivers, which is a raster data.

  # load country + biome data
drivers <- rast("revamp/drivers/curtis_et_al_orig.tif") %>%
  project("epsg:4326") %>%
  writeRaster("revamp/drivers/drivers_curtis.tif")
}
```

## Move external data to GEE and prepare all information there

The first step of the data analysis workflow of Wolf et al. consisted in fetching data from Google Earth Engine. They downloaded each dataset (forest cover, forest loss, forest gain, elevation, slope, travel time and population density) as separate raster files to process them locally on their own computer. Because of the massive amount of such data, the subsequent steps in their analysis workflow are complex, rely from different languages, a large number of libraries (several of them now deprectated), fails to run and we are unable to debug it.

The Google Earth Engine can be leveraged to do much more than only downloading data, and therefore we plan to re-implement on this cloud environment the data preparation steps, instead of doing it locally on individual machines.

We use the R package `rgee` as an interface to Google Earth engine API [@aybar2020].

```{r}
# Sometime rgee does not find the right python env, so we specify it
reticulate::use_python("C:/Users/fbede/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/rgee")
library(rgee) # accesses GEE through its python API
library(rgeeExtra)
ee_Initialize(user = "ndef", drive = TRUE, )
dir.create("revamp/gee")
```

We start by uploading the country, biome and deforestation drivers' data prepared in the previous step.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# We add this manually, as we had issues with API auth. protocol for GSC
drivers_curtis <- ee$Image("projects/ee-fbedecarrats/assets/drivers_curtis")
# We also load the AOIs manually due to the same problem
if (!file.exists("revamp/aois/aois_shp.zip")) {
  dir.create("revamp/aois")
  st_write(aois, "revamp/aois/aois.shp")
  aoi_files = list.files(path = "revamp/aois", pattern = "aois.*", 
                         full.names = TRUE)
  zip(zipfile = "revamp/aois/aois_shp.zip", files = aoi_files)

  paint(featureCollection = aois_ee,
        color = "biome_num")
biome_nation_borders <- ee$Image()$byte()$
  paint(featureCollection = aois_ee,
        color = 1,
        width = 1)

Map$addLayer(biome_fills, list(min = 1, max = 7, palette = r_map_palette)) +
  Map$addLayer(biome_nation_borders, list(palette = "000000"))
```

# Clip Hansen data with biome polygons

Instead of downloading and processing all the GFC data like Wolf and al., we instead keep only the data located within the perimeter of the biomes of interest.

```{r}

  max = c(1, 255, 1)))

# Stack information as bands in a single raster

Wolf et al. downloaded each information source in a separate raster, that they later on joined. We find easier and less error-prone to stack all the information as bands of the same raster. The data might be downloaded in separate files for different national segment of each biome, but for the same regions, all the complementary information is attached to the same pixels with the same resolution (alias, a "clean" table).

# This function takes as an enty a GEE FeatureCollections and returns an GEE

The previous code creates for each area of interest a raster with the following bands: cover, loss, lossyear, elev, slope, travel_time, pop_dens, PA, WDPA ID number, PA_status_yr, PA_buffer, country, biome.

Now we will iterate to download this raster in separated file, with one file per national segment of each biome of interest.

```{r}
# This loops over countries, but the data is only extracted for areas that
# are within a biome of study.
my_countries <- unique(aois$GID_0)
country_tasks <- tibble(country = my_countries)
dir.create("revamp/gee")
# each country takes between less than 1 and 32 minutes to process. 
# The computations run in parallel.
aois_ee <- ee$FeatureCollection("projects/ee-fbedecarrats/assets/aois")
for (i in 58:length(my_countries)) {
  GID <- my_countries[i]
  print(paste0(GID, " ", i, "/", length(my_countries)))
  aoi_country <- aois_ee$filter(paste0("GID_0 == '", GID,"'"))
  aoi_extract <- prepare_gee_data(aoi_country)
  ee_as_raster(
    aoi_extract, via = "drive", container = "rgee_country", lazy = TRUE,
    dsn = paste0("revamp/gee/", GID, ".tif"),
    skipEmptyTiles = TRUE, scale = 1000,
    region = aoi_country$geometry())
}

ee_print(aoi_extract)
```

We have 211 rasters for 201 national territories. The file names are a concatenation of 3 letters indicating the country (ISO3 country code), a time-stamps of when the GEE task was launched, plus a number when the country is split in several different countries. Sometimes GEE splits a territory in 2 or 3 rasters. It is the case for Canada, Russia, USA, Fiji, China, New Zealand, Kirghistan and UMI (?). The splitting of a country in several rasters happens when the forest biome areas of the corresponding countries are disjoint and GEE apparently optimises the output file sizes this way.

Each raster is in WSG-84 projection with cells of 1km2 and includes 37 bands, all including integer values:

-   cover: forest cover in 2000 (Hansen 2019 data)
-   loss: a boolean for forest cover loss between 2001 and 2018 (Hansen 2019 data)
-   lossyear_as_wolf: the loss year registered by Wolf, which is the mode of the lossyear for the \~1000 underlying cells in the original Hansen data (30x30m resolution)
-   elev: mean elevation
-   slope: slope
-   travel_time: time travel to the nearest city
-   pop_dens: population density
-   country_num: an integer indicating the country (number + ISO3 list to be annexed to the data)
-   biome_num: an integer indicating the biome according to WWF map of ecoregions
-   ecoreg: an integer indicating the eco-region according to WWF map of ecoregions
-   is_pa: an integer indicating if the cell overlaps with a terrestrial protected area (MARINE == 0, NB: coastal --both marine and terrestrial PAs-- are excluded, following Wolf procedure) with a status different from proposed, a spatial footprint (not just points in WDPA) and an area superior to 1km2 (WDPA version as of march 2023).
-   is_pa_buffer: is distant within a distance of 10km or less from a cell registered as PA
-   wdpa_id: the identification number of the PA. In case that several PAs overlap, only the first one in WDPA registry order is mentionned.
-   status_year: the year in which the PA received its current status
-   driver: the main deforestation driver according to curtis et al
-   loss_2021: a boolean for forest cover loss between 2001 and 2021 (Hansen 2022 data)
-   loss_nnnn: 21 fields where nnnn is a year number between 2001 and 2021, with values corresponding to the the sum of underlying deforesed cells
