# Summary

This document provides a technical description of the process we are following to reproduce and replicate the work titled "A forest loss report card for the world’s protected areas" published in *Nature Ecology & Evolution* by Wolf, Levi, Ripple, Zárrate-Charry and Betts [-@wolf2021]. Before starting any analysis, we specified the objectives of this exercises and the different steps we intend to follow in @sec-preanalysis_plan. Our intents to create a computing environment able to run wolf and al. code is presented in @sec-computing_setup. The code published by Wolf and al. automatically fetches a subset of the data required by the statistical computation, but some sources links need to be updated. @sec-data_preparation describes these updates and how to obtain the data that is missing when using only the published code. @sec-reproducion_asis describes the subsequent steps followed to execute the code, including some coding errors that we found. At this stage, we failed to execute the whole code published by the authors and to reproduce their results. We plan to contact directly the authors to inform them of our attempts and ask for their help to debug the code execution.
